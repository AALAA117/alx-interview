# 0x05. N Queens

## Description

The N Queens problem is a classic algorithmic challenge in computer science and mathematics. The task is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack each other. A queen can attack another queen if they share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This project demonstrates the application of **backtracking algorithms** to find all possible solutions to this problem, leveraging **recursion** to explore and evaluate different configurations of queens on the board.

## Learning Objectives

To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand the following concepts:

### 1. Backtracking Algorithms

- **Backtracking** is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally and abandoning solutions ("backtracking") as soon as it's determined they cannot lead to a valid solution.

### 2. Recursion

- **Recursion** is the process of defining a function in terms of itself. It's a powerful tool for problems like the N Queens where the solution involves breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.

### 3. Python List Manipulation

- Lists are used to store the positions of queens on the board, and knowledge of list operations in Python is essential.

### 4. Python Command Line Arguments

- The program will accept input from the command line using the `sys` module, which allows users to specify the value of `N` (the size of the board).

## Requirements

- **Editors**: You are allowed to use `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3** (version 3.4.3).
- Each file must end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should adhere to the **PEP 8** style (version 1.7.\*).
- All files must be executable.
